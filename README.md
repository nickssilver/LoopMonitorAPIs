# LoopMonitorAPIs
</hr>
LoopMonitorAPIs is a *backend API* project that provides restaurant owners with a report of their stores' online status during business hours. The API polls store data hourly and processes it to generate a report containing store uptime, downtime, and update status. The project includes two endpoints: a *trigger_report* endpoint to initiate report generation and a *get_report* endpoint to retrieve the report. The data sources are stored in a database and can be updated regularly.
