# LoopMonitorAPIs
</hr>
LoopMonitorAPIs is a `backend API` project that provides restaurant owners with a report of their stores' online status during business hours. The API polls store data hourly and processes it to generate a report containing store uptime, downtime, and update status. The project includes two endpoints: a `trigger_report` endpoint to initiate report generation and a `get_report` endpoint to retrieve the report. The data sources are stored in a database and can be updated regularly.
